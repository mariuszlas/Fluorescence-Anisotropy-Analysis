Notifications for plate 1  repeat 1:
WARNING: Some of the results may be invalid due to saturation of electronics. To fix the problem try to limit the excitation light or decrease the detector gain using the label editor.
In a case of label using Fluorescence Monochromator you can also try to use less flashes  lower excitation wavelength or higher emission wavelength.

WARNING: Measured signal is saturated in the following wells: G06
